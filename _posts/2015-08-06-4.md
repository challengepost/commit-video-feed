This week, Neal interviewed Matt Gerrior, one of Devpost's Sr. Engineers, to learn about pair programming. Matt's got some great <a href="https://www.devmynd.com/blog/2015-1-pairing-with-junior-developers/">tips from Devmynd</a>, so bookmark this one. We also highlighted two great projects from <a href="http://dchacks.devpost.com">DCHacks</a> and <a href="http://sjmaps.devpost.com">Maps as Art</a>. FYI, we're fired up for Hackathon season and we'll be at PennApps, MHacks, Disrupt SF, and HackNY in September.
